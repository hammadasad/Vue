Learning Vue

- I read up a lot on Vue (primarily Reddit) and was suggested to use it for projects due to its simplicity.
- Before diving into React, I want to give it a go to be able to compare.

Benfits of Vue
- Simplicity
- Easy to transition from HTML/CSS/JS
- Progressive (can be used as a framework or just a library)
- Fast!
- Very portable/light
- MVVM Data manipulation
